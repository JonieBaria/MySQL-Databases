CROSS JOIN & SELF JOIN in MySQL
1. CROSS JOIN â€“ Cartesian Product
A CROSS JOIN returns the Cartesian product of two tables.

It combines each row from the first table with every row from the second table.
No condition (ON clause) is needed.
Example: CROSS JOIN Without Condition

SELECT customers.name, products.product_name
FROM customers 
CROSS JOIN products;
If customers has 3 rows and products has 4 rows, the result will have:
ðŸ‘‰ 3 Ã— 4 = 12 rows (all possible combinations).

2. SELF JOIN â€“ Joining a Table to Itself
A SELF JOIN is when a table is joined with itself to compare its rows.

Example: Find Employees and Their Managers

SELECT emp1.name AS employee, emp2.name AS manager
FROM employees emp1
JOIN employees emp2 ON emp1.manager_id = emp2.id;
emp1 represents employees.
emp2 represents their managers.
âœ… This helps when data is hierarchical (like employees reporting to managers).

Key Differences

CROSS JOIN	Returns all possible row combinations	Creating test datasets, permutations
SELF JOIN	Joins a table with itself	Employee-manager relationships
