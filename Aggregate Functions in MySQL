COUNT()	Counts the number of rows
SUM()	Adds up numerical values
AVG()	Calculates the average of values
MIN()	Finds the smallest value
MAX()	Finds the largest value

1. COUNT() – Count Rows

Example: Count total customers

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_customers FROM customers;

Example: Count customers from the USA

SELECT COUNT(*) AS usa_customers 
FROM customers 
WHERE country = 'USA';

2. SUM() – Total Sum
The SUM() function calculates the total sum of a column.

Example: Total sales for all orders

SELECT SUM(sales) AS total_sales FROM orders;

Example: Total sales per product

SELECT product_id, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM orders
GROUP BY product_id;

3. AVG() – Average Value
The AVG() function calculates the average value of a column.

Example: Average order 

SELECT AVG(sales) AS avg_order_amount FROM orders;

Example: Average salary per department
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;

4. MIN() – Minimum Value
The MIN() function finds the smallest value in a column.

Example: Find the lowest product price

SELECT MIN(price) AS lowest_price FROM products;

Example: Find the lowest salary per department

SELECT department, MIN(salary) AS lowest_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;


5. MAX() – Maximum Value
The MAX() function finds the largest value in a column.

Example: Find the highest product price

SELECT MAX(price) AS highest_price FROM products;

Example: Find the highest salary per department

SELECT department, MAX(salary) AS highest_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;



Combining Aggregate Functions
You can use multiple aggregate functions in a single query.

Example: Show total, average, min, and max sales


SELECT 
    SUM(sales) AS total_sales,
    AVG(sales) AS avg_sales,
    MIN(sales) AS min_sales,
    MAX(sales) AS max_sales
FROM orders;


Using Aggregate Functions with HAVING
The HAVING clause filters aggregated results after GROUP BY.

Example: Show only products with total sales over $10,000

SELECT product_id, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM orders
GROUP BY product_id
HAVING total_sales > 10000;
